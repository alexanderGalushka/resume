## Résumé contents

This résumé is based on my real skills and experience. Everything you read in there is true.

### Reusing as a template

Anyone is welcome to re-use this résumé as a template for their own.

The best way to modify the contents is to fork this repo and go through the source code of `index.html` line by line to edit as you see fit.

The **layout and styles** are based on [Bootstrap v.4](https://getbootstrap.com/). I merged their blog and gallery examples with some of my own ideas.

I used some **commercial icons** from [FontAwesome Pro](https://fontawesome.com/). They require a paid subscription. You can opt out by using their free styles and designs. I find the Pro version more elegant and well worth the money.

### Print or PDF versions

Google Chrome prints a better version than FireFox, but neither is good enough when printed or saved as PDF.
Append `?prn` to the URL to produce a simplified, single page version with a link to the full version on GitHub. E.g. https://resume.rimutaka.me/?prn.

## Thinking behind the format

A product manager is a very varied role. You are not really an inventor, but you are creating something completely new at the same time. So I approached this résumé project as *just another product*. I defined my preferred *type of customer*, looked around for good ideas and put some of them into a form that hopefully appeals to the target audience.

* **Customer:** a CEO or a founder of a small to mid-size business working on a new product. They have resources, but not too much to still need someone agile and scrappy.
* **Minimal layout:** that's just my style - I like to keep things simple and focus on the contents.
* **Show, don't tell:** avoid superlatives and self-assessments. Let the readers decide for themselves.
* **Flow:** 
  * Who I am
  * What I am
  * What I can do for you
  * What I made for others
  * Skills I learned
  * Social proof (what others say about me)
  * What makes me tick
  * My growth path, what I learned
  * Misc
  * Sharing with the community

I intentionally **omitted some skills and traits** from the document. They should be evident by looking at this project as a whole. If they are not, then they shouldn't be included anyway. *E.g. do I know anything about marketing or do I have attention to detail?*

The absence of **education section** is due to my lack of formal education. There is some room in the sidebar to insert yours.

The **printing template** is intentionally stripped down from most of the content and links directly to GitHub:
* this is a living document, which a PDF file is not
* my target audience doesn't need explaining what GitHub is
* they can always print the full version if they need to

So the printing template is a document you submit to some online HR system because it only takes a PDF or MS Word file. If what they see in there is not enough to make them reach for the online version it's probably a lost cause anyway. I may be completely wrong here.
